# Codifikids
In today's digital society, knowledge of computing is a valuable skill for anyone, but in the future, it will no longer be a differentiator—it will become essential. That’s why CodifiKids was created—a programming logic course designed for children, based on the American K-12 educational model. This system encompasses all levels of education, from Kindergarten through 12th grade, providing a structured and continuous approach to learning. To ensure an inclusive and democratic education that allows access for all, this course is offered in public schools. It aims to teach the fundamental pillars of computing, such as Computational Thinking:

- Decomposition: Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts.
- Abstraction: Focus on the important details and ignore the irrelevant ones.
- Pattern Recognition: Identify and use patterns in solutions to simplify the process.
- Algorithm: Create a clear and precise sequence of steps to solve problems.
  
The goal is to inspire students to explore and engage with computing in all its forms. The course currently has 500 students enrolled across more than 16 schools.
